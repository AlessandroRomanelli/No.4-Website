        | When somebody joins the No.4 Commando unit he's already guaranteed a unique, immersive experience. Fight the Axis powers, save the free world using the finely recreated historical gear, weapons and vehicles of the WW2 Era. Gun down entire enemy squads behind your Bren gun, or sneak up a enemy patrol with our Stens, or maybe jump out a plane into the most iconic scenarios whilst pushing deep within enemy territory. The possibilities are endless. Whilst on one side our unit is supported by skilled and fastly growing developers, it also has great mission makers and custom contents creators, who make for an extra-degree of immersion when it comes to stage an operation.
